## Question

I am planning to build a Single Page Application for a URL shortener application using VITE + Vanilla TS (without using any framework such as React and/or Angular). Tell what are the various things that I should take care of? 

FYI There is a Spring boot backend API which secures every request to it. Here some info.

Authentication Flow & State Management
Auth Strategy
* Backend: HttpOnly cookies for security
* Frontend: SessionStorage for UI state
* Flow:
   1. User logs in via modal on static page
   2. Backend sets HttpOnly cookie + returns session data
   3. Frontend caches session info in sessionStorage
   4. Redirect to /dashboard (SPA world)
Session Management
* 401/403 Response: Clear sessionStorage + redirect to home
* Logout: Backend clears cookie + Frontend clears sessionStorage
* State Sync: Session data cached from API responses

I have setup a VITE + Vanilla TS project and add TailwindCSS Version 4. 

Above is for your context.. Do not generate any code yet

## Answer

Building a URL shortener SPA with Vite + Vanilla TS is a great choice for performance and control. Here are the key areas you should focus on:

## Project Architecture & Structure

**Modular Organization**: Structure your TypeScript code with clear separation of concerns - separate modules for routing, API calls, UI components, state management, and utilities. Consider using barrel exports for cleaner imports.

**Type Safety**: Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for your API responses, session data, URL entities, and component props. This will catch errors early and improve maintainability.

## Routing & Navigation

**Client-Side Router**: Implement a robust hash-based or history API router that can handle nested routes, query parameters, and route guards. You'll need programmatic navigation for redirects after auth events.

**Route Protection**: Create middleware to check authentication state before rendering protected routes like `/dashboard`. Redirect unauthenticated users appropriately.

**Deep Linking**: Ensure all routes work when accessed directly via URL, not just through navigation.

## State Management & Session Handling

**Centralized State**: Build a lightweight state management system to handle user session, application state, and data caching. Consider using the observer pattern for reactive updates.

**Session Validation**: Implement periodic session validation since you're using sessionStorage. Check if the backend session is still valid, especially after idle periods.

**Graceful Degradation**: Handle network failures and session expiry gracefully with proper error boundaries and user feedback.

## UI Architecture

**Component System**: Create reusable UI components (modals, forms, tables, buttons) with consistent APIs. Use TypeScript classes or factory functions for component encapsulation.

**Event Management**: Implement proper event delegation and cleanup to prevent memory leaks, especially important in SPAs.

**Responsive Design**: Leverage TailwindCSS v4's new features effectively, ensuring the app works well on all device sizes.

## API Integration & Security

**HTTP Client**: Build a robust HTTP client wrapper that automatically handles authentication headers, request/response interceptors, and error handling.

**CSRF Protection**: Ensure your requests include any CSRF tokens required by your Spring Boot backend.

**Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for different HTTP status codes, network failures, and validation errors.

## Performance Considerations

**Code Splitting**: Use Vite's dynamic imports to split your code by routes or features, reducing initial bundle size.

**Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for heavy components like data tables or charts.

**Caching Strategy**: Cache API responses appropriately and implement optimistic updates for better UX.

**Asset Optimization**: Leverage Vite's built-in optimizations and consider implementing service workers for offline functionality.

## Development & Build Process

**Environment Configuration**: Set up proper environment variable handling for different deployment environments.

**Hot Reload**: Ensure your routing and state management work well with Vite's HMR.

**Build Optimization**: Configure Vite properly for production builds, including proper chunking strategies.

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**: Test your utility functions, state management, and API clients in isolation.

**Integration Testing**: Test component interactions and routing flows.

**E2E Testing**: Consider tools like Playwright for testing complete user workflows.

## Accessibility & UX

**Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

**Screen Reader Support**: Implement proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML.

**Loading States**: Provide clear feedback during API calls and route transitions.

**Error Messages**: Display user-friendly error messages for validation and network failures.

The key to success with Vanilla TS is building solid abstractions early - your routing system, component architecture, and state management will be the foundation everything else builds upon. Take time to design these well upfront rather than retrofitting later.

## Question 

What will be the first step for implement this application?

## Answer

The first step should be **establishing your core application architecture and routing system**. Here's the logical progression:

## Step 1: Define Your Application Structure

Start by creating a solid folder structure and defining your core TypeScript interfaces:

```
src/
├── types/           # TypeScript interfaces & types
├── core/           # Core application logic
│   ├── router/     # Routing system
│   ├── state/      # State management
│   └── http/       # API client
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/          # Page-level components
├── utils/          # Utility functions
└── styles/         # Additional styles if needed
```

## Step 2: Build Your Router First

The router is the backbone of your SPA. You need this working before anything else because:
- It determines how your app loads and renders content
- Authentication redirects depend on it
- All other components will be rendered through route changes

Key router requirements for your app:
- Handle `/dashboard` vs static home page routing
- Support programmatic navigation for auth redirects
- Route guards for protected pages
- Handle browser back/forward navigation

## Step 3: Create Your State Management System

Since you're using sessionStorage for UI state, you need a centralized way to:
- Store and retrieve session data
- React to state changes across components  
- Handle session expiry and cleanup
- Sync with API responses

## Step 4: Build Your HTTP Client

Create your API communication layer that:
- Handles the HttpOnly cookie authentication automatically
- Manages 401/403 responses (clear session + redirect)
- Provides consistent error handling
- Integrates with your state management

## Why This Order?

1. **Router enables everything else** - You can't build pages or handle auth flows without navigation
2. **State management comes next** - Your router and API client both need to interact with application state
3. **HTTP client depends on both** - It needs to trigger navigation on auth failures and update state on successful responses

Once you have these three core systems working together, you can start building your actual UI components and pages. The authentication flow you described will naturally work once these foundations are in place.

Would you like me to help you implement the router system first, or would you prefer to start with a different piece?

## Question

Yes I have created the suggested folder structure. Lets start with the router system. Help me with the code please. Make sure the code should be pure TypeScript (no framework such as react or angular), and should be production grade.

## Answer
I'll help you build a production-grade router system in pure TypeScript. 

<code files>

Let me create a comprehensive routing solution for your URL shortener application.I've created a comprehensive, production-grade router system for your URL shortener application. Here's what I've built for you:

## Router System Components

### 1. **Type Definitions** (`router.ts`)
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for routes, contexts, guards, and navigation
- Custom `NavigationFailure` class for proper error handling
- Strong typing for parameters, query strings, and route metadata

### 2. **Route Matching Utilities** (`utils.ts`)
- Advanced path-to-regex conversion supporting `:param` and `*` wildcards
- Query string parsing and stringification
- Path normalization and parameter extraction
- Nested route support

### 3. **Core Router Class** (`Router.ts`)
- Support for both hash and history modes
- Concurrent navigation protection
- Route guards system (global and route-specific)
- Proper error handling with custom error types
- Browser history integration (back/forward buttons)
- Pending navigation handling

### 4. **Authentication Guards** (`guards.ts`)
- `authGuard` - Protects authenticated routes
- `guestGuard` - Redirects authenticated users from public pages
- `adminGuard` - Role-based access control
- `metaGuard` - Flexible meta-based routing rules
- Rate limiting and logging guards

### 5. **Main Router Setup** (`index.ts`)
- Pre-configured routes for your URL shortener app
- Singleton pattern for router instance
- Helper functions for navigation
- Example route handlers

## Key Features

✅ **Production Ready**: Error handling, concurrent navigation protection, memory cleanup
✅ **TypeScript First**: Complete type safety throughout the system
✅ **Authentication Integration**: Built-in guards that work with your sessionStorage approach
✅ **Flexible Routing**: Supports parameters, wildcards, nested routes, and query strings
✅ **Browser Integration**: Handles back/forward buttons, direct URL access, and page refreshes
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Efficient route matching and minimal re-renders

## Integration with Your Auth Flow

The router is designed to work seamlessly with your authentication strategy:
- Guards check `sessionStorage` for session data
- Automatic redirects on 401/403 (you'll implement this in your HTTP client)
- Smooth transitions between authenticated/unauthenticated states

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with your main app**: Import and initialize the router in your entry point
2. **Implement page renderers**: Replace the placeholder render functions with your actual UI rendering logic
3. **Connect with state management**: The router will integrate with your state management system
4. **Add route-specific logic**: Customize the route handlers for your URL shortener features

The router is ready to use and will handle all navigation concerns for your SPA. Would you like me to help you integrate it with your main application file or move on to building the state management system?
